#we define a neural network with two hidden layers, with 32 and 16 neurons respectively, and a softmax output layer with three neurons, corresponding to three possible events. We use the relu activation function for the hidden layers and softmax for the output layer.

#We then define the training data as an array of 2D points, and the corresponding labels as an array of integers indicating which event took place. We compile the model using the adam optimizer and sparse_categorical_crossentropy as the loss function. We then train the model for 100 epochs.

#Finally, we test the model with new data by creating a test set of 2D points, and using the predict method to get the predicted probabilities for each possible event. The predicted probabilities are returned as a 2D array with shape (3, 3) where each row corresponds to a test point and each column corresponds to a possible event. The index of the highest probability in each row indicates the predicted event.
